## Project Overview
"Guardian Angel" is a tangible learning kit designed to improve children's spatial literacy. 
Itâ€™s an Arduino-based navigation tool with a digital compass and 8 LED lights to guide users to their destination. 
The device includes geofencing functionality, sending alerts via the Twilio API if a child strays from a defined area.

A companion website was developed using **Django**, **Python**, and the **Leaflet API** to provide interactive maps and further enhance the educational experience.
